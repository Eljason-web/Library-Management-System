# Library Management System
 Task Description: Library Management System  Objective: Develop a Library Management System in Java that allows users to manage books and patrons efficiently. The system should provide functionalities for adding, removing, and searching for books and patrons, as well as managing the borrowing and returning of books.  Requirements:  1. Class Structure:    - Implement the following classes:      - Book: Represents a book in the library.        - Attributes:          - title (String): The title of the book.          - author (String): The author of the book.          - isbn (String): The ISBN number of the book.          - isAvailable (boolean): Indicates if the book is currently available for borrowing.        - Methods:          - Getters and setters for all attributes.          - toString(): Returns a string representation of the book.       - Patron: Represents a library member.        - Attributes:          - name (String): The name of the patron.          - patronId (String): A unique identifier for the patron.          - borrowedBooks (List<Book>): A list of books currently borrowed by the patron.        - Methods:          - Getters and setters for all attributes.          - borrowBook(Book book): Allows the patron to borrow a book.          - returnBook(Book book): Allows the patron to return a borrowed book.          - toString(): Returns a string representation of the patron.       - Library: Manages the collection of books and patrons.        - Attributes:          - books (List<Book>): A list of all books in the library.          - patrons (List<Patron>): A list of all patrons registered in the library.        - Methods:          - addBook(Book book): Adds a new book to the library.          - removeBook(String isbn): Removes a book from the library using its ISBN.          - listBooks(): Displays all books in the library.          - searchBook(String title): Searches for a book by its title.          - addPatron(Patron patron): Registers a new patron in the library.          - removePatron(String patronId): Removes a patron from the library using their ID.          - listPatrons(): Displays all registered patrons.          - searchPatron(String name): Searches for a patron by their name.          - borrowBook(String patronId, String isbn): Allows a patron to borrow a book.          - returnBook(String patronId, String isbn): Allows a patron to return a borrowed book.  2. User  Interface:    - Implement a console-based user interface that allows users to interact with the library system.    - Provide a menu with options to:      - Add a book      - Remove a book      - List all books      - Search for a book      - Add a patron      - Remove a patron      - List all patrons      - Search for a patron      - Borrow a book      - Return a book      - Exit the application  3. Data Validation:    - Ensure that appropriate validation is performed for user inputs, such as checking if a book or patron already exists before adding, and ensuring that a book can only be borrowed if it is available.  4. Documentation:    - Include comments in your code to explain the functionality of each class and method.    - Write a brief README file that describes the project, how to run it, and any dependencies required.  Deliverables: - Source code for the Library Management System. - README file with project description and instructions. - A demonstration of the system's functionality (optional, but recommended).  Evaluation Criteria: - Correctness: The system should function as specified. - Code Quality: Code should be well-organized, readable, and properly commented. - User Interface: The console interface should be user-friendly and intuitive. - Data Handling: Proper validation and error handling should be implemented.
